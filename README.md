# Blank Pattern to configure OpenShift clusters

[hub-blank-vpattern](https://github.com/jtovarro/hub-blank-vpattern) acts as a blank papper to easily customize and apply day 2 configurations to MANO clusters using the Validated Pattern Framework. 

Validated patterns are living code architectures for different edge computing and hybrid cloud use cases. They're created by using Helm Charts, a collection of files that describe a set of related Kubernetes resources.
